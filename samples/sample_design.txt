# This sample would work for a directory structured like this:
# C:\sequencing\dna_sequencing_run1692\dna_sequencing_sample1.ab1
# C:\sequencing\dna_sequencing_run3498\dna_sequencing_sample2.ab1
# C:\sequencing\dna_sequencing_run2984\dna_sequencing_sample3.ab1
# C:\sequencing\dna_sequencing_run2323\dna_sequencing_sample4.ab1
#
# You can make a contig consisting of many .ab1 files, even if they come from separate runs

# You can also use only a subset of the data from each file
